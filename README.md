<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The scope of this project was to create an inclusive, interactive registration form using JavaScript.</p>


<h3>Comments</h3>

<h4>Real-time error messages</h4>

<p>The goal of any form is to ensure the data supplied by the user is necessary and properly formatted to complete operations successfully.</p>
<p>Using JavaScript the user's input will be validated as they type, providing a responsive user experience.</P>
<p>Required information should be validated as a necessity since without this information the form cannot be completed, therefore on this basis I opted to provide real-time validation for all required fields.</p>

<h4>Conditional error messages</h4>

<p>To ensure my form is user friendly and inclusive for all regardless of ability I have added conditional messages to all user input fields.</p>
<p>The aim here is to provide unique descriptive and informative messages to the user about their input and what needs to be corrected.</p>
